Data from Skin Cancer (animal) study where 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. 

Given Data from study: 
Mouse_metadata.csv
Study_results.csv
       
Purpose of Analysis: 
The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Analysis:
Prepared data by merging the mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame.
Generated summary statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.
 
Created the following:
bar charts using pandas and  Matplotlib
pie charts using pandas and  Matplotlib
Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot using Matplotlib
Create a line plot and a scatter plot using Matplotlib
Calculate correlation and regression using Matplotlib

Final analysis: 
Overall, the conclusion from the data analyzed is that the Drug Regimen Capomulin reduces the size of tumors
